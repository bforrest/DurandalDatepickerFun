DurandalDatepickerFun
=====================

Fun with durandal and jQuery UI date picker

Experiments trying to get the jquery UI date picker to play nicely with the Durandal observable plugin module.

For a quick and easy web server on OSX I just navigate to the project directory in a terminal window and enter => python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
